# Summary
This project was created using only HTML & CSS. While working on this project, I was able to learn new techniques on how to add images to pages with "img" tags. I also learned how to add CSS style to a page and have it all link together with a named class attribute. While working on this project the hardest part was to know how to style each block separately & understanding how to use unordered list with anchor tags. Feels very satisfing to know I was able to apply the skills acquired to complete this assignment and have everything running smooth.
